    "abstract": "Since 1994, Ceredigion County Council and a network of shore-based volunteer observes have monitored levels of boat traffic and the occurrence of bottlenose dolphins at seven sites on the coast of Cardigan Bay, Wales. We report high rates of site use and site occupancy by this species during the summer. Although trends in site use may not reflect population trends in the wider region, these data were consistent with recent abundance estimates that indicate that the number of bottlenose dolphins using Cardigan Bay is stable or slightly increasing.  Cardigan Bay is a Special Area of Conservation for bottlenose dolphins and other species and habitats. Recreational boating is known to have the potential to cause disturbance to cetaceans and this monitoring study provides data that underpins the effectiveness of management.",
