    "description": "The zooplankton dataset contains samples collected during 2001-2010; from different stations; from the Romanian Black Sea waters. Samples were collected from different depths; in different seasons . All samples were collected using the modified Juday net; with an opening of 36 cm diameter. Zooplankton samples were analyzed both from quantitative (density and biomass) and qualitative (list of species) point of view.",
