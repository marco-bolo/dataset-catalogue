"VLIZdataset1","LifeWatch imagery plankton dataset:zooplankton","In the framework of the Lifewatch marine observatory a number of fixed stations on the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) are visited on a monthly or seasonal basis using the RV Simon Stevin. A grid of nine stations covers the coastal zone and are sampled monthly. Eight additional stations, located further at sea, are sampled on a seasonal basis. This dataset contains zooplankton observations in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) since 2012. Zooplankton is sampled by vertical WP2 net tows, samples scanned with ZooScanner and identification with plankton analyser software, followed by manual validation.","VLIZ","VLIZ, JonasM, RuneL, KlaasD","zooplankton, Belgian EEZ, LifeWatch, ZooScan",7,"LW-BE","text/csv"," "

In the framework of the Lifewatch marine observatory a number of fixed stations in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) are visited on a monthly or seasonal basis using RV Simon Stevin. A grid of nine stations covers the coastal zone and are sampled monthly. Eight additional stations, located further at sea, are sampled on a seasonal basis. Samples are taken using a 55µm mesh size Apstein net and fixed in Lugol's iodine solution. In the lab, the samples are processed using a VS-4 FlowCAM model at 4X magnification, size range imaged is 55-300µm. The identification of the image data is done with the use of a classifier and followed by a manual validation step.  Since May 2017, this dataset provides micro- and phytoplankton observations, mainly covering diatoms, dinoflagellates and cilliates, for the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS).","VLIZ","VLIZ, RuneL, JonasM, KlaasD","phytoplankton, Belgian EEZ, LifeWatch, FlowCam",5,"LW-BE","text/csv"," "
