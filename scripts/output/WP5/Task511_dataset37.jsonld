    "description": "In the framework of the Lifewatch marine observatory a number of fixed stations on the Belgian Part of the North  Sea (BPNS) are visited on a monthly or seasonal basis using the RV Simon Stevin. A grid of nine stations covers the coastal zone and are sampled monthly. Eight additional stations; located further at sea; are sampled on a seasonal basis. This dataset contains zooplankton observations in  the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) since 2012.Zooplankton is sampled by vertical WP2 net tows; samples scanned with  ZooScanner and identification with plankton analyser software; followed  by manual validation.",
