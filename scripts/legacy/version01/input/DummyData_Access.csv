"VLIZdataset5"," ",,"The indicators and the LW explorer data will be part of the Belgian MSFD monitoring and assessment programme, not sure yet about the EOVs, BMCD (belgian marine data centre) will contact I to tell them, they have a submission process and format. Some of that LW data were alsogive to the OSPARE ODIMS when they had a data call, but they are not interested in the indicators just the raw data. So with the scientific publication, we could write a data publication. Note that MSFD has a 6 year cycle, 2024 is next one. We would like assistence from WP1 in knowing where to publish our EOVs and Indicators"
