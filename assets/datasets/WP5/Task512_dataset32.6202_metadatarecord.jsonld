    "description": "The CETUS dataset contains data collected within the CETUS Project (www.cetusproject.com), a cetacean monitoring programme in the Eastern North Atlantic, running since 2012. The project is led by the Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR - University of Porto, Portugal), in partnership with TRANSINSULAR - Grupo ETE, a Portuguese company for maritime transport, that offers its cargo ships to be used as a platforms of opportunity to monitor cetaceans along routes between Continental Portugal and Madeira, Azores, Canary and Cape Verde islands. On-board trained marine mammal observers collect data on: survey effort, cetacean and other megafauna occurrences, as well as marine traffic and meteorological conditions. Data is provided in the recent OBIS-ENV-DATA format, and comprises 8913 georeferenced positions associated with 3195 occurrences of 44 marine taxa.  Acknowledgements We are extremely grateful to TRANSINSULAR that provided all the logistic support for data collection, and to the ship crews for their hospitality. This research was partially funded by the EU FEDER/FEMP and Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) under the Portugal2020 (Lisboa2020, Algarve2020 and MAR2020) Programme through project OBSERVA.PT (MAR-01.04.02-FEAMP-0002).
