    "description": "Time series of phytoplankton abundance collected with a monthly frequency at 0.5; 5; 10 and 15 meters in the Gulf of Trieste. The time series station C1; located in the Gulf of Trieste in the northernmost part of the Adriatic Sea; is part of the Adriatic Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site. It is a shallow coastal station (17 m depth) located at 0.2 Km from the coast; at the outer border of the Natural Marine Reserve of Miramare; Trieste. More information about activities carried out and about datasets from other periods can be found at: http://nettuno.ogs.trieste.it/ilter/GoTTs/en_index.html. Samples were fixed with Ca(HCO3)2-buffered formaldehyde (0.8% final concentration) and cell abundance was estimated according to Uterm\u00f6hl\u2019s method (1958); using an inverted microscope equipped with phase contrast; at 200-320-400x final magnifications. Abundant cells were counted in defined random fields; rarer species were counted on the whole chamber (Fonda Umani et al.; 2007).",
