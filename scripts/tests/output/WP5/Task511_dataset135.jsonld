    "description": "Phytoplankton abundance data collected within the framework of the RADIALES time series monitoring program; carried out by the CSIC-IEO. The sampling is undertaken monthly from 1989 at five stations in North and Northwest Spanish shelf.Samples were taken at several depth strata using Niskin bottles mounted on a CTD rosette. They were fixed with Lugol and preserved until they were analysed at the laboratory under the inverted microscope following the Uterm\u00f6hl method.&#39;",
