    "abstract": "Epibenthos and demersal fish monitoring at long-term monitoring stations Trawl samples were taken within the disposal site and outside the disposal site (close neigbourhood) (classic controle/impact design). Sampling activities were in February-March and in September/October. A 8 meter shrimp beam trawl (22 mm mesh in the cod end) equipped with a bolder chain was used.The net was towed during 30 or 15 minutes at an average speed of 4 knots.",
