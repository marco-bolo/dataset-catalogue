    "description": "Boat-based acoustic and visual surveys for harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were conducted during the summers of 2001 and 2002 in order to investigate their distribution and relative abundance in the Baltic Sea, and to compare the results with the adjacent Kiel and Mecklenburg Bights and the Little Belt.  Harbour porpoises are subject to year-round bycatch in gillnets and other fishing gear in these waters. This is of particular concern in the Baltic Sea where a survey carried out in 1995 indicated that the population is low and current levels of anthropogenic mortality are believed to be unsustainable.",
