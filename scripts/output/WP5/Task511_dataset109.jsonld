    "description": "Monthly mesoozooplankton samplings started in 1950s; performed by vertical tows of Hensen net (73 cm mouth diameter; 330 \u03bcm mesh size) from 35\u20130 m. Samples were fixed in 2 % formaldehyde solution buffered with borax. No flowmeter was used. From 1950s-1995 mesozooplankton was sampled on approximately monthly basis and data are available from January 1972 to November 1995 (with gaps in 1975) and include the abundances expressed as no.ind.m-3 at group level of the zooplankton groups such as Copepoda; Cladocera; Appendicularia; Chaetognatha; Tunicata; Ostracoda; Polychaeta; Decapoda larvae; various meroplankton larvae; Pisces ova; Pisces larvae and Hydromedusae/Siphonophora. From 1995 the sampling program with Hensen net was interrupted and investigations continued with Nansen net; 125 \u03bcm mesh size.",
