    "description": "We provide datasets that include parameters regarding phytoplankton community; primary production and chl a measurements. Chlorophyll a concentrations analysis started from 1972 till 2017 and included coastal and open waters stations. Phytoplankton community analysis consist of datasets started from 1952-2017 while primary production measurements were obtained from 1962.",
