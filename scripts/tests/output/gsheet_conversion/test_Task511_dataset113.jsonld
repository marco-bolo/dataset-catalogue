    "description": "The macrozoobenthos dataset includes a number of  243 samples collected in the Northern part of the Romanian littoral between Sulina and Chituc from 10 m to 57m depths. Van Veen grab with a sampling area of 0.05 m2 was employed as a macrozoobenthos sampler. One replicate  was collected at every station. Sampling was done in spring; summer and autumn mounths.The samples have been analyzed qualitative (number of species) and quantitative (densities and biomasses). The macroinvertebrates have been identified at species level. Dataset contains abundance data (ind/m2) and biomass (g/m2). The macroinvertebrates have been identified at species level.",
