    "description": "The macrozoobentos dataset includes a number of 234 samples collected in the East Constanta sector of the Romanian marine waters from five standard stations (Station 1-5) between 14 m to 55m depths. Van Veen grab with a sampling area of 1/20 m2 was employed as a macrozoobenthos sampler. One replicate was collected at every station. Sampling was done in winter; spring; summer and autumn mounths.The samples have been analyzed qualitative (number of species) and quantitative (densities and biomasses). The macroinvertebrates have been identified at species level.",
