    "description": "Spatial and temporal trends in the distribution of the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena, white-beaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris, and minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata were assessed at a coastal North Sea study area in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Between March 1999 and October 2001, cetacean data were collected using both land- and vesselbased survey methods. A total of 174 sightings of these three cetacean species was recorded during approximately 330 h of combined survey effort (228 h land-based and 102 h vessel-based).  The data were collected to analyse the distribution and seasonality of cetacean species in the region, in order to provide recommendations for their long-term conservation and management.",
