    "description": "The dataset consists of abundance records of 43 marine species in the Mediterranean Sea from 2001 to 2020. Selected species include some protected and non-indigenous species; ecosystem engineers; species sensitive to climate change; and/or threatened by human activities. Taken together; these taxa represent key ecological aspects of Mediterranean subtidal habitats (Cerrano et al.; 2017)  and can be used to calculate the MedSens; an index of the environmental status of subtidal rocky coastal habitats based on species sensitivity (Turicchia et al.; 2021). Observations were carried out by the EcoDivers (trained scuba divers; freedivers and snorkelers) according to a rigorous protocol (RCMed U-CEM) developed by the association Reef Check Italia onlus.",
