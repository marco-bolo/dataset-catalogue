    "description": "Every year; Wageningen Marine Research carries out shellfish surveys in the Dutch coastal waters (Wadden Sea; Oosterschelde; Westerschelde and Coastal Zone); investigating the distribution and size of the most important commercial shellfish species. These are mainly mussels; cockles; knife hives and Japanese oysters; but also other species with a certain importance for ecology or fishing are included. In addition; catch data from professional fishing are also collected. The data is used by the government when deciding whether or not to permit fishing.",
