    "abstract": "The dataset comprises data on the substrate type and benthos from 14 samples colected in NW Black Sea in the August 1998. The quantitative (1/133 m2) undisturbed sediment samples were taken with a multicorer Mark II-400, the integral 0-15 cm layer of surface sediment were retained, preserved in 4% formaldehyde. The database comprises taxonomic and quantitative data (density and wet weight biomass per square meter) for 28 macrobenthic species and 2 supraspecific groups.",
