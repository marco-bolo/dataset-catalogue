    "description": "The macrozoobentos dataset includes a number of 347 samples collected in the Northern part of the Romanian littoral between Sulina and Chituc from 5 m to 52m depths. Van Veen grab with a sampling area of 1/20 m2 was employed as a macrozoobenthos sampler. One replicate was collected at every station. Sampling was done in spring; summer and autumn mounths.The samples have been analyzed qualitative (number of species) and quantitative (densities and biomasses). The macroinvertebrates have been identified at species level.",
