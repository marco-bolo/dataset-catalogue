    "description": "Total numbers of individual fish identified during the Cefas Young Fish Survey (YFS) which ran from 1981 to 2010. The survey deployed a light 2-meter beam trawl to survey inshore locations for small / young fish around the British Isles; predominantly along the south and east coasts. Total numbers of fish (identified to species or if not to the highest taxonomic level) were recorded at each station; and were measured in the majority of cases. The surveys were primarily undertaken to evaluate the abundance of juvenile sole and plaice; as well as providing further information on the abundance of other species of fish. The YFS formed part of the International Young Fish Survey; coordinated by ICES.",
