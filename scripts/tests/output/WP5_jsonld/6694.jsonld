    "description": "&#34;Phytoplankton data collected in the Black Sea between 1981 and 1990 and processed by Usurelu M., Ruta G., Skolka H., and Bodeanu N. This dataset contains abundance data (cells per liter) and biomass (mg/m3) for individual phytoplankton taxa. Samples were taken by 1L Nansen bottle at  standard depths. The standard sedimentation technique for samples preparation (Morozova-Vodianitkaia, 1954) was used. Data were collected from coastal/shallow to shelf Romanian waters  from various transects such as: Constanta, Chituc, Sulina, Portita, Mangalia etc.Phytoplankton abundance was counted by specialists using data sheets which contained abundance per station. After counting all the individuals from a subsample under the microscope, the scientific team calculated the total phytoplankton abundance and biomass. For each record the maximum and minimum sampling depth is recorded.&#34;",
