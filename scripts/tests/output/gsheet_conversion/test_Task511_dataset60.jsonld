    "description": "Data on demersal and mega-benthic species were sampled in the context of the MEDITS suveys carried out on the Spanish Mediterranean continental shelf since 1994.  MEDITS is a program of bottom trawl surveys developed annually in the Mediterranean; in which all the participants use the same gear; sampling protocol and methodology; with the objective to evaluate the abundance and distribution of stocks; independently of the data provided by commercial fisheries; and to assess the impact of the fishing activity on the environment.",
