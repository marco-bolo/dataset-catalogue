    "description": "Data on incidental sightings of cetaceans reported to the Institute of Marine Research by letter or telephone; as well as information from newspapers; have been collected since 1967. From the late 1970s; data have also been obtained from research vessels; coast guard vessels; some fishing vessels and inspectors. These reports contain basic information on date; position and species; but also additional information such as group sizes. These sightings are not useful for assessing abundance; but might reveal distributional aspects. Most of the reports come from the northern areas (Barents Sea); this is clearly related to the distribution of the activities which form the basis for this kind of reporting.",
