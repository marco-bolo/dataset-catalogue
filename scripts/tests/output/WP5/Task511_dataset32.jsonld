    "description": "The first “organized” and regular biological observations at the time series station C1 in the Gulf of Trieste; North Adriatic Sea; date back to the early 1970s and were initiated by the University of Trieste. A regular monthly sampling for hydrological; chemical as well as biological (phytoplankton and zooplankton in several size classes) analysis began later; in 1986. The time series station C1; initiated by the University of Trieste; was later taken care by the Laboratory of Marine Biology of Trieste after its formal institution in December 1979 and; since October 2005; by the Department of Biological Oceanography; now Division of Oceanography (OCE) of OGS; Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e Geofisica Sperimentale of Trieste. ",
