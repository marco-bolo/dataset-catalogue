    "description": "Long term measurements of benthos composition in the Dutch national part of the North Sea. Samples have been taken by benthic sledge; box-corer; video and Hamon sampler. Samples were taken annually between 1991-2010; in 2012 and in 2015 and analysed to the genus or species level. For video sampling; coverage percentages were measured. The dataset has been used for assessment of the marine environment and habitat quality in the scope of the OSPAR Quality Status Reports and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.",
