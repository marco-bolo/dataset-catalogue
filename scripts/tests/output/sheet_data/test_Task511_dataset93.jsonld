    "description": "The Phytoplankton National Monitoring Programme for the identification and enumeration of phytoplanktonic species is an important measurement in the detection of those species which may form a Harmful Algal Bloom event. Where favourable environmental conditions occur; some species may form &#39;blooms&#39; where high cell densities may cause water discolouration; foaming; mass mortalities of fish; shellfish; invertebrate and benthic organisms through oxygen depletion or produce biotoxins which can accumulate in species of filter feeding bi-valve molluscs; which can cause a variety of human illnesses if consumed when placed on the market for human consumption.",
