Van Veen grab with a sampling area of 1/20 m2 was employed as a macrozoobenthos sampler. One replicate was collected at every station. Sampling was done in spring, summer and autumn mounths.The samples have been analyzed qualitative (number of species) and quantitative (densities and biomasses). The macroinvertebrates have been identified at species level.",
