VLIZplankton_dataset1,Kexter,LifeWatch Observatory: ZooScan outputs (2012-present),"In the framework of the Lifewatch marine observatory, a number of fixed stations on the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) are visited using the RV Simon Stevin. A grid of nine stations covers the coastal zone and are sampled monthly; eight additional stations, located further at sea, are sampled on a seasonal basis. Zooplankton is sampled by vertical WP2 net tows, samples are scanned with ZooScanner, and identification is done with plankton analyser software followed by manual validation. This dataset contains zooplankton observations since 2012, more specifically the outputs from the ZooScan: images and classifications.",,These data are stored in a local database that is not web-connected.

VLIZplankton_dataset3,Kexter,LifeWatch Observatory: FlowCam outputs (2017-present),"In the framework of the Lifewatch marine observatory, a number of fixed stations in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) are visited using RV Simon Stevin. A grid of nine stations covers the coastal zone and are sampled monthly; eight additional stations, located further at sea, are sampled on a seasonal basis. Samples are taken using a 55mum mesh size Apstein net and fixed in Lugol's iodine solution. In the lab, the samples are processed using a VS-4 FlowCAM model at 4X magnification, size range imaged is 55-300mum. The identification of the image data is done with the use of a classifier and followed by a manual validation step. This provides micro- and phytoplankton observations since May 2017, mainly covering diatoms, dinoflagellates and cilliates.
