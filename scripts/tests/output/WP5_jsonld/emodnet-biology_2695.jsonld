    "description": "Dataset contains zooplankton data obtained during ecological monitoring in the Black Sea, Ukrainian part 1996-2005.  For data 1992-1993: Sampling was done by Juday net N49 mesh size = 0,168 mm. Samples were taken by standard depths from 200m (or bottom) to surface – 5 layers in deep-water regions. Also additional samples were taken every 25 m in limits 200-25m. In limits 25m – surface number of samples were taken according thermohaline water structure. Samples were sorted by macro and mezo plankton. Mezoplankton was analyzed under binocular directly on ship board. Abundance of each species was calculated according standard methods, for most abundant species adult and copepodit stages were calculated. Structure of both combs (Mnemiopsis and Pleurobrachia) population was identified by 3-9 size classes with body length measurements.  1996 - 2006: Sampling instrument - Jedy&#39;s net N 49, mesh size = 0,168 mm; fixation: formalin; sampling surface area - arranged as per sampling depths from the surface to the sea bed; depth of sampling - on standard levels, m.
