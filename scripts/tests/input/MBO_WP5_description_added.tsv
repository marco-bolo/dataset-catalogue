Data are stored in the Swedish Ocean Archive database (SHARK), by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. Data should be sampled and analyzed according to MacIsaac E A and Stockner J G 1993. Enumeration of phototrophic picoplankton by autoflourescence microscopy. In Handbook of methods in aquatic microbial ecology. Kemp P F, Sherr B F, Sherr E B, and Cole J J (eds.) Lewis, Boca Raton. pp. 187-197. However, deviations from the manual might occur.

The sampling is undertaken monthly from 1989 at five stations in North and Northwest Spanish shelf.  Samples were taken at several depth strata using Niskin bottles mounted on a CTD rosette. They were fixed with Lugol and preserved until they were analysed at the laboratory under the inverted microscope following the Utermöhl method. "			"Completed"
